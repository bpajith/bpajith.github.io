This is the revised version of the book. [The First Version](history)  was written before ten years.

The changes are mainly due to Python3, chapters related to numerical methods are also revised.

Download the PDF version from [HERE](pythonForEducation.pdf).

Download the [Example Programs](code.zip) 

You can practice python coding from websites like [Trinket.io](https://trinket.io/python3).
Copy the following lines
```python
from pylab import *
x = linspace(-pi, pi, 50)
plot(x, sin(x))
show()
```
Open [Trinket.io](https://trinket.io/python3) , paste it and execute.
 
The book contains a lot of simple programs that are tested. More involved examples will be available on this website rather than bloating the book.
