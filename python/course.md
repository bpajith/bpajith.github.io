The course is conducted online using Bigbluebutton, an open source web conferencing tool. 
[Video instruction for Online class](bbb.mp4) . This video also explains
how to practice Python on a browser, but we decided not to use it during the class to avoid the extra load on the network.

It is advisable to have a GNU/Linux system installed on your computer. For beginners Ubuntu may be a good choice. During the course we will be using the 'geany' IDE. The video below explains howto configure it to print the program output in the built-in terminal, something convenient while sharing windows using Bigblubutton. Creating a file and saving it with a .py extension configures the build commands of 'geany'. You should change the default setting of 'python' to 'python3' from the 'Build->Set Build Commands' menu.
