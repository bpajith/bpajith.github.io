## Why this Site ?
Technology has been changing very fast. Computer programs and documentation, of 1980s, that I kept on the floppy disks of a PDP-11 computer became unreadable long back. Then lost the backup material kept of $5\frac{1}{2}$" floppies, along with those obsolate drives. Some of the stuff on hard discs and CDs survived numerous system upgradations but it becomes nearly impossible to locate something when it is needed. Links to useful resources on the web, found after long searches or by chance, are also getting lost.
Now (during May-2020) a small thing on the broder of living and non-living, covid-19 virus, has put a break on other activities and providing time to make an attempt to organize some material, resulting in this website. 

Most of the stuff is on science experiments and scientific computation. Code written in Python is a major part of it. Then there are links to some science books, that I found interesting,  without mathematical equations. Being a personal website, you may find many other material that may or may not be interesting to you.
