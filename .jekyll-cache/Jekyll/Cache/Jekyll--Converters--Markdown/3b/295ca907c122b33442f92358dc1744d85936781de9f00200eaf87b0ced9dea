I"²<p>Differential equations are one of the most important mathematical tools used in producing models for physical and biological processes. Analytic solutions are available in some cases but numerical methods are employed for solving most of the problems encountered in science and engineering. The value of a function $f(x)$ and itâ€™s derivative $f\prime(x)$ are known for some initial value of $x$. The objective is to find the value of $f(x)$ for other values of  $x$, proceeding in small steps.</p>

<p>Here we explore some of the popular methods for solving the initial value problems involving ODEs. The focus will be on solving simple examples using Python programming language. The Python basics required for understanding the examples is given</p>
