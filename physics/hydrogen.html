    <p>Hydrogen atom</p>
    <p>Had a look at the document posted by Vinod G on the theory of <a href="hydrogen.pdf">Hydrogen
        atom</a>. The graph of the potential is&nbsp; drawn by hand, still a
      common practice. What I thought is a graph plotted using proper equations
      could be more useful.</p>
    <p>The python program <a href="potential.py">potential.py</a> gives the
      following output.</p>
    <p><img src="potential.png" alt="" style="width: 492px; height: 369px;"></p>
    <p>From the graph, we can see that the minimum value is around 1e-10 meter,
      double the value of Bohr radius. One can modify the code, by changing the
      value of angular momentum. It is important to range of radius to be
      plotted also. </p>
    <p>Obtaining some numerical values of important parameters from equations
      and graphs, and comparing them with the documented values may make
      learning these things more meaningful and interesting. </p>
